# iMessage Exporter

This tool was built to help my Grandfather export his iMessages from his iPhone to a format that he could read and store digitally. It's a utility that is mainly just to take a SQLite file from an iOS backup and convert it into something that most computers can open (a CSV). 

## Usage

To hack on this project, you can run the Vite server which (doesn't actually do all that much) or open `index.html`  since I forked this nice project from [@inloop here](https://github.com/inloop/sqlite-viewer). It has been around a long time and thus my implementation is a nasty amalgamation of tools like bootstrap, jQuery, Tailwind, and vanilla JS.
